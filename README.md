# Boston housing prediction

This project focuses on predicting the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) in the Boston area based on various features using Machine Learning. The dataset used is the popular Boston Housing Dataset, and the project demonstrates a complete pipeline from exploratory data analysis (EDA) to training and evaluating a regression model.

Problem Statement
 - Predict the median value of homes in Boston based on 13 input features like crime rate, number of rooms, proximity to highways, and more.

The Boston Housing Dataset contains 506 instances and 14 attributes (13 features + 1 target). The goal is to predict the MEDV column (median value of homes in $1000).

Technologies Used
 - Python
 - Pandas, NumPy (Data manipulation)
 - Matplotlib, Seaborn (EDA & Visualization)
 - Scikit-learn (Modeling and evaluation)
